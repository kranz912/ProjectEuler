Solving Euler problems

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. (https://projecteuler.net/about)

I will be using python for this challenge

### Problem 1:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```python
sum =0;
for x in range(1,1000):
    if(x%3==0 or x%5 == 0):
        sum+=x
print(sum)
```
### Problem 2:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```
numbers=[0,1];
x=0;
sum=0
while(True):
    if(x!=0):
        n= numbers[x] + numbers[x-1]
        if (n > 4 * 10 ** 6):
            break
        numbers.append(n)
        if(n%2==0):
            sum+=n;
    x += 1
print(sum)
```
the solution above can be solved using a recursive function for computing the fibbonaci value of n, but since it will be ineffienct having O(n^2) runtime. I used an array to store the previous numbers to have O(n) runtime but having additional space of O(n).
